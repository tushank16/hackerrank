### Task

Return an array of two integers denoting the respective comparison points earned by Alice and Bob.

### Sample Input 0
```
5 6 7
3 6 10
```
### Sample Output 0
```
1 1
```
> Here there is a tie and in one game alice had a point and another one bob had a point

### Sample Input 1
```
17 28 30
99 16 8
```
### Sample Output 1
```
2 1
```
> Here bob gets one point (because 99 > 17) but other two points are won by Alice so returning [2, 1];

### Code
```
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int arr1[3];
    int arr2[3];
    int a=0,b=0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        cin>>arr1[i];
    }

    
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
       cin>>arr2[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
    {
        if (arr1[i]>arr2[i]) 
        {
            a++;
        }
        if (arr1[i]<arr2[i]) 
        {
            b++;
        }
    }
    cout<<a<<" "<<b<<endl;
    return 0;
}

```
